# UnityRuby
 Ruby Scripting in Unity/C#


HOW IT WORKS
* You will need a copy of GlitchEnzo's NuGet Package for Unity

Using NuGet, Install IronRuby, it will install to the directory of the Unity Build you are currently using

In your Build folder there will be a Lib/IronRuby Folder this directory is used to read any Ruby Scripts that need to be 
accessed in C#/Unity3d

While currently we're writing an Interface Class to more easily use IronRuby in Unity, IronRuby commands will work and 
can be used to execute your custom scripts (examples in progress)

RoadMap:
TBD

Bugs:
N/A (For Now)
